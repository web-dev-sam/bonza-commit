    <b>Bonza Commit</b>
  </h2>
  <p>This mini-program uses pylint and eslint to check for coding-style issues before each commit, keeping the code clean.</p>
</div>


<br>&nbsp;<br>
## Installation (Ubuntu)
 * Install Python 3 and pip
 * Install npm if you want to check javascript code
 * Run `pip3 install inquirer`
 * Run `git clone https://github.com/MindLaborDev/bonza-commit.git .bonza` in your repositories root directory (in same directory as `.git`).
 * Run `python3 .bonza/install`.

When you are about to commit, it will abort the commit if it finds coding-style issues (based on the configurations). If you want to enforce a commit use `git commit --no-verify`.


<br>&nbsp;<br>
## Workflow
 * Run `./.bonza/check` for coding-style analysis (if you have checked *Only changed files* during installation stage your files first using the `git add` command).
 * Use `./.bonza/check --fix` to fix some of the issues automatically (Saves the fixes to your files).
 * Use `./.bonza/check --dryfix` to fix some of the issues automatically (Doesn't save the fixes; just shows analysis with fixes applied).
 * Use `./.bonza/check --compact` to output issues in a more compact way.
 * Edit `.eslintrc.json` and `pylintrc` to change eslint and pylint rules. You can find more about them at [pylint](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/technical_reference/features.html) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

## Ignoring folders and files

#### Javascript (ESLint)
Create a `.eslintignore` file in your repository root directory and add the files and folders that you want to exclude from Javascript analysis in there. The syntax is the same as for a `.gitignore` file.
<br>&nbsp;


<br>&nbsp;<br>
## Troubleshooting
 * If you get a _pylint syntax error_ even though your code works perfectly fine. Try running pylint with a newer python version. Just edit the `.bonza/install` file or your git hook so pylint gets called using a newer version: `... python3 -m pylint ...`.
